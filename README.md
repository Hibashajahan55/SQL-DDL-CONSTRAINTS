# SQL-DDL-CONSTRAINTS

# Sales Database and Orders Table: DDL Constraints Project
# Project Overview
This project involves creating a database called "Sales" and performing various operations such as creating tables with constraints, adding and renaming columns, inserting records, retrieving data, and updating/deleting rows. It demonstrates the use of DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands along with key constraints like Primary Key, Unique, and Not Null.
# Steps

1. **Create Database & Table**:
   - Create the Sales database and Orders table with constraints (Primary Key, Unique, Not Null).

2. **Modify Table**:
   - Add a new column `order_quantity` and rename the table to `sales_orders`.

3. **Insert Data**:
   - Insert 10 rows with customer orders.

4. **Retrieve Data**:
   - Select `Customer_name` and `Ordered_item` from `sales_orders`.

5. **Update Data**:
   - Change the `Ordered_item` for a specific order .

6. **Delete Table**:
   - Drop the `sales_orders` table.
  
# Conclusion
This project illustrates the effective use of DDL constraints to maintain data integrity and ensure structured data management in SQL. Constraints like Primary Key, Unique, and Not Null help enforce rules that prevent invalid data entry and ensure database reliability.
